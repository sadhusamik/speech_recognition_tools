# Neural network based GEV beamformer

## Introduction

This repository contains code to replicate the results for the 3rd CHiME challenge using a *NN-GEV* Beamformer.

## Install

This code requires Python 3 to run (although most parts should be compatible with Python 2.7). Install the necessary modules:

```
pip install chainer
pip install tqdm
pip install SciPy
pip install scikit-learn
pip install librosa
```

## Usage

  1. Extract the speech and noise images for the SimData using the modified Matlab script in CHiME3/tools/simulation
  2. Start the training for the BLSTM model using the GPU with id 0 and the data directory ``data``:
  
      ```
      python train.py --chime_dir=../chime/data --gpu 0 data BLSTM
      ```
      
      This will first create the training data (i.e. the binary mask targets) and then run the training with early stopping. Instead of ``BLSTM`` it is also possible to specify ``FW`` to train a simple feed-forward model.
      
  3. Start the beamforming:
  
    ```
    beamform.sh ../chime/data data/export_BLSTM data/BLSTM_model/best.nnet BLSTM
    ```
    
    This will apply the beamformer to every utterance of the CHiME database and store the resulting audio file in ``data/export_BLSTM``. The model ``data/BLSTM_model/best.nnet`` is used to generate the masks.
    
  4. Start the kaldi baseline using the exported data.

  If you want to use the beamformer with a different database, take a look at ``beamform.py`` and ``chime_data`` and modify it accordingly.

## Results
With the new baseline, you should get the following results:
