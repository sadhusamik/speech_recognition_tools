The tools and programs contained in this package is designed and 
distributed for use in REVERB challenge. For detailed information on 
the challenge, visit the challenge website 
(reverb2014.dereverberation.com). The REVERB challenge consits of 
speech enhancement and automatic speech recognition tasks, and the 
tools and programs contained in this distribution are provided for
participants in the speech enhancement task. The following is a quick 
guide to get things started. 

Questions, inquiries, and bug reports to the REVERB challenge 
organizers (REVERB-challenge@lab.ntt.co.jp).

Preliminaries

Before starting, 
  (1) Please carefully read Guidelines.pdf and the challenge website 
      for detailed information on the data used for the challenge, how 
      to obtain the data sets, general guidelines thatparticipants are 
      expected to follow, etc. 
  (2) Please carefully read taskfiles/README for explanation about task 
      files. Each task file define a list of speech files that are 
      required to be enhanced for each evaluation category (i.e., 
      SimData/RealData, development/evaluation/training, 1ch/2ch/8ch, 
      far/near, room1/room2/room3).			


********************
Usage

To get started, follow the following steps. 

  1. Obtain REVERB challenge data from LDC
     To take part in the challenge, participants need to obtain the 
     data from LDC (Linquistic Data Consortium). Detailed information
     on this can be found in the challenge website. The website also
     provides some example speech files. 

  2. Download evaluation tools from the challenge website
     If you are reading this, it means you have already downloaded 
     these evaluation tools. So you have nothing to do in this step.

  3. Run skeleton codes provided
     Move to the directory named 'skeleton'. Open 'process_SimData.m'
     and 'process_RealData', and change the value of 
     'download_from_ldc' to an appropriate directory name. Launch
     MATLAB, and then the skeleton code for SimData can be run as
     % process_SimData
     The skeleton code for RealData can also be run as
     % process_RealData
     These skeleton codes read input (i.e., noisy and reverberant) 
     signals, create a directory named 'output', and simply store the 
     read signals in the output directory without modification. 

  4. Score the outputs
     Move to the directory named 'evaltools' and launch MATLAB. Then,
     score the outputs of the skeleton codes as (before running these 
     codes, be sure to change the value of 'download_from_ldc')
     % score_SimData
     % score_RealData
     This calculates several objective speech quality measures and 
     stores the results in a directory named 'scores'. The objective
     speech quality measures used for the challenge are explained in 
     Guideline.pdf and the challenge website. In the 'score' directory, 
     you find two files named 'score_SimData' and 'score_RealData' 
     created, which summarize the evaluation results for SimData and 
     RealData, respectively. For example, 'score_SimData' lools like

     Data type   : SimData
     Date created: xx-xxx-2013 xx:xx:xx

How to install PESQ

By default, PESQ is not calculated. PESQ is an ITU-T recommended 
measure for assesment of narrow-band speech quality. In this challenge,
ITU-T Recommendation P.862 Ammendment 2 (P.862.2) is assumed, which 
supports wideband speech input. To use this version of PESQ, you need 
to download the source codes of the official implementation from the 
ITU-T website. This can be obtained from the following link. 
http://www.itu.int/rec/dologin_pub.asp?lang=e&id=T-REC-P.862-200511-I!Amd2!SOFT-ZST-E&type=items

On Linux systems, the source codes can be compiled with GCC 4 as
% cd Software/P862_annex_A_2005_CD/source
% gcc -o PESQ *.c -lm
This generates an executable file named 'PESQ'. 

Finally, move to 'evaltools' directory and open 'score_SimData.m'. 
Then, uncomment the line defining 'pesqdir' and modify the value of 
this variable to the directory where the PESQ executable can be found.
If the name of the PESQ executable is different from 'PESQ', you also
need to modify the value of 'pesqexe'.
